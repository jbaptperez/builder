# Caldera Plugin: Builder

The Builder plugin enables Caldera to dynamically compile code segments into payloads that can be executed as abilities 
by implants.

### Installation:

Install the required docker components with the following command:
```Bash
sudo ./install.sh
```

### Dependencies/Requirements:
1. Docker
2. docker-py

### Sample Ability

The following ability will compile the HelloWorld.exe executable, copy it to the machine running the agent, and execute
it using either cmd or PowerShell.

```yaml

  name: C# Hello World
  description: Dynamically compile HelloWorld.exe
  tactic: execution
  technique:
    attack_id: T1059
    name: Command-Line Interface
  platforms:
    windows:
      psh,cmd:
        build_target: HelloWorld.exe
        language: csharp
        code: |
          using System;

          namespace HelloWorld
          {
              class Program
              {
                  static void Main(string[] args)
                  {
                      Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");
                  }
              }
          }
```

DLL dependencies can be added by declaring a `payloads` list at the root of the ability.
